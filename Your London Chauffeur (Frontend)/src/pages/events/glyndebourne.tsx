         "Nestled in the embrace of a six-century-old English country house, the Glyndebourne Festival Opera is an annual spectacle from May to August near the charming town of Lewes in East Sussex. A tradition since 1934, the venue earned accolades for its renditions of Mozart operas. Today, it boasts a broader array, embracing both Handel and Janacek operas. Though once held within the historical house's walls, the opera now resonates from its dedicated opera house adjacent to the principal residence. And the cherry on top? The esteemed London Philharmonic Orchestra, which graces Glyndebourne as its resident orchestra, elevates each performance. Join us with YLC and journey through a musical legacy."],
